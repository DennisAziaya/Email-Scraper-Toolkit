# Email Scraper Toolkit

The "Email Scraper Toolkit" is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the process of extracting email addresses from web pages. Whether you need to compile a contact list for marketing purposes or gather leads for your business, this toolkit provides a flexible and easy-to-use solution.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping Made Easy:** The toolkit leverages the power of the `requests` library and BeautifulSoup for seamless web scraping, allowing you to retrieve email addresses with just a few lines of code.
